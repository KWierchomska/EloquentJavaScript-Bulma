                        <p>Imagine a sea of bits—an ocean of them. A typical modern computer has more
                          than 30 billion bits in its volatile data storage (working memory). Nonvolatile
                          storage (the hard disk or equivalent) tends to have yet a few orders of magnitude
                          more.
                          To be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost, we must
                          separate them into chunks that represent pieces of information. In a JavaScript
                          environment, those chunks are called values. Though all values are made of bits,
                          they play different roles. Every value has a type that determines its role. Some
                          values are numbers, some values are pieces of text, some values are functions,
          and so on.
          To create a value, you must merely invoke its name. This is convenient. You
          don’t have to gather building material for your values or pay for them. You
          just call for one, and whoosh, you have it. They are not really created from
          thin air, of course. Every value has to be stored somewhere, and if you want to
          use a gigantic amount of them at the same time, you might run out of memory.
          Fortunately, this is a problem only if you need them all simultaneously. As
          soon as you no longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving behind its bits to
          be recycled as building material for the next generation of values.
          This chapter introduces the atomic elements of JavaScript programs, that is,
          the simple value types and the operators that can act on such values.

                    <h1 class = "title is-8">Numbers</h1>
                    <p>Values of the number type are, unsurprisingly, numeric values. In a JavaScript
                      program, they are written as follows: 13
                      Use that in a program, and it will cause the bit pattern for the number 13
          to come into existence inside the computer’s memory.
          JavaScript uses a fixed number of bits, 64 of them, to store a single number
          value. There are only so many patterns you can make with 64 bits, which means
          that the number of different numbers that can be represented is limited. With
          N decimal digits, you can represent 10N numbers. Similarly, given 64 binary
          digits, you can represent 264 different numbers, which is about 18 quintillion
          (an 18 with 18 zeros after it). That’s a lot.
          Computer memory used to be much smaller, and people tended to use groups
          of 8 or 16 bits to represent their numbers. It was easy to accidentally overflow
          such small numbers—to end up with a number that did not fit into the given
          number of bits. Today, even computers that fit in your pocket have plenty of
          memory, so you are free to use 64-bit chunks, and you need to worry about
          overflow only when dealing with truly astronomical numbers.
          Not all whole numbers less than 18 quintillion fit in a JavaScript number,
          though. Those bits also store negative numbers, so one bit indicates the sign of
          the number. A bigger issue is that nonwhole numbers must also be represented.
          To do this, some of the bits are used to store the position of the decimal point.
          The actual maximum whole number that can be stored is more in the range of
          9 quadrillion (15 zeros)—which is still pleasantly huge.
          Fractional numbers are written by using a dot.
          9.81 
          For very big or very small numbers, you may also use scientific notation by
          adding an e (for exponent), followed by the exponent of the number.
          2.998e8
          That is 2.998 × 108 = 299,800,000.
          Calculations with whole numbers (also called integers) smaller than the
          aforementioned 9 quadrillion are guaranteed to always be precise. Unfortunately, calculations with fractional numbers are generally not. Just as π (pi)
          cannot be precisely expressed by a finite number of decimal digits, many numbers lose some precision when only 64 bits are available to store them. This
          is a shame, but it causes practical problems only in specific situations. The
          important thing is to be aware of it and treat fractional digital numbers as
          approximations, not as precise values.
