                      <p>
                        It is often useful to have a value that distinguishes between only two possibilities, like “yes” and “no” or “on” and “off”. For this purpose, JavaScript has a
                        Boolean type, which has just two values, true and false, which are written as
                        those words.<br><br>
                        <h2 class = "title is-4">Comparison</h2>
                        Here is one way to produce Boolean values:<br>
                        <strong>
                            console.log(3 > 2)
                            // → true
                            console.log(3 < 2)
                            // → false
                        </strong> <br>
                        The > and < signs are the traditional symbols for “is greater than” and “is
less than”, respectively. They are binary operators. Applying them results in
a Boolean value that indicates whether they hold true in this case.
Strings can be compared in the same way.
The way strings are ordered is roughly alphabetic but not really what you’d
expect to see in a dictionary: uppercase letters are always “less” than lowercase
ones, so "Z" < "a", and nonalphabetic characters (!, -, and so on) are also
included in the ordering. When comparing strings, JavaScript goes over the
characters from left to right, comparing the Unicode codes one by one.
Other similar operators are >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or
equal to), == (equal to), and != (not equal to).<br>
There is only one value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, and that is
NaN (“not a number”). NaN is supposed to denote the result of a nonsensical computation, and as
such, it isn’t equal to the result of any other nonsensical computations.

                  <div class = "tile is-child box">
                      <h1 class = "title is-8">Logical operations</h1>
                      <p>
                        There are also some operations that can be applied to Boolean values themselves. JavaScript supports three logical operators: and, or, and not. These
                        can be used to “reason” about Booleans.
                        The && operator represents logical and. It is a binary operator, and its result
                        is true only if both the values given to it are true.
                        The || operator denotes logical or. It produces true if either of the values
given to it is true. Not is written as an exclamation mark (!). It is a unary operator that flips
the value given to it—!true produces false, and !false gives true.
When mixing these Boolean operators with arithmetic and other operators,
it is not always obvious when parentheses are needed. In practice, you can
usually get by with knowing that of the operators we have seen so far, || has
the lowest precedence, then comes &&, then the comparison operators (>, ==,
and so on), and then the rest. The last logical operator I will discuss is not unary, not binary, but ternary,
operating on three values. It is written with a question mark and a colon, like
this: <strong>console.log(true ? 1 : 2);
    // → 1
    console.log(false ? 1 : 2);
    // → 2
    </strong> This one is called the conditional operator (or sometimes just the ternary
    operator since it is the only such operator in the language). The value on the
    left of the question mark “picks” which of the other two values will come out.
    When it is true, it chooses the middle value, and when it is false, it chooses the
    value on the right.
