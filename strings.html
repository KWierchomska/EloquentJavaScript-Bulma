                            The next basic data type is the string. Strings are used to represent text. They
are written by enclosing their content in quotes.Almost anything can be put between quotes, and JavaScript will make a
string value out of it. But a few characters are more difficult. You can imagine
how putting quotes between quotes might be hard. Newlines (the characters
you get when you press enter) can be included without escaping only when
the string is quoted with backticks (\‘).
To make it possible to include such characters in a string, the following
notation is used: whenever a backslash (\) is found inside quoted text, it
indicates that the character after it has a special meaning. This is called
escaping the character. A quote that is preceded by a backslash will not end
the string but be part of it. When an n character occurs after a backslash, it is
interpreted as a newline. Similarly, a t after a backslash means a tab character.
Take the following string: <strong>"This is the first line\nAnd this is the second"</strong> The actual text contained is this: <br>
<strong>
    This is the first line<br>
And this is the second<br>
</strong> There are, of course, situations where you want a backslash in a string to
be just a backslash, not a special code. If two backslashes follow each other,
they will collapse together, and only one will be left in the resulting string
value. Strings, too, have to be modeled as a series of bits to be able to exist inside
the computer. The way JavaScript does this is based on the Unicode standard.
This standard assigns a number to virtually every character you would ever
need, including characters from Greek, Arabic, Japanese, Armenian, and so
on. If we have a number for every character, a string can be described by a
sequence of numbers.
And that’s what JavaScript does. But there’s a complication: JavaScript’s
representation uses 16 bits per string element, which can describe up to 216
different characters. But Unicode defines more characters than that—about
twice as many, at this point. So some characters, such as many emoji, take
up two “character positions” in JavaScript strings. We’ll come back to this in

                            together.</p>
